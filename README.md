# OIL-BEARING-ZONE-PREDICTION-AI-
A Geo-AI project that uses synthetic seismic attributes to classify potential oil-bearing zones. The dataset is generated using basic geophysical rules, and a Random Forest model is trained to detect oil vs non-oil regions. Includes visualizations, feature importance, and evaluation.
